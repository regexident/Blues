/// The `PeripheralManager` class is an abstraction of the Peripheral and Broadcaster GAP roles,
/// and the GATT Server role. Its primary function is to allow you to manage published services
/// within the GATT database, and to advertise these services to other devices.
/// Each application has sandboxed access to the shared GATT database. You can add services to the
/// database by calling `addService:` they can be removed via `removeService:` and
/// `removeAllServices`,as appropriate. While a service is in the database, it is visible to and
/// can be accessed by any connected GATT Client. However, applications that have not specified
/// the "bluetooth-peripheral" background mode will have the contents of their service(s)
/// "disabled" when in the background. Any remote device trying to access characteristic values or
/// descriptors during this time will receive an error response. Once you've published services that
/// you want to share, you can ask to advertise their availability and allow other devices to
/// connect to you by calling {@link startAdvertising:}. Like the GATT database, advertisement is
/// managed at the system level and shared by all applications. This means that even if you aren't
/// advertising at the moment, someone else might be!
